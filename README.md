# UserList

1. A table bound to the data “user.json”

   showing the following columns

   - Name
   - Age
   - Registered Date, format dd-mm-yyyy dd:mm:ss
   - Email
   - Balance , format currency as pounds to 2 decimal places

   sorted by “Name” ascending by default

   we are not interested in paging

2. A “Search” input and label
   - Typing in the search input filters the table results by “Name”
3. A button named “Reset Balance” that sets all of users balances to zero and reflects this in the view.
